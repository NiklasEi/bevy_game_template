# A Bevy game template

Template for a Game using the awesome [Bevy engine][bevy] featuring out of the box builds for Windows, Linux, macOS, Web (Wasm), Android, and iOS.

# What does this template give you?

* small example ["game"](https://niklasei.github.io/bevy_game_template/)
* easy setup for running the web build using [trunk] (`trunk serve`) 
* run the native version with `cargo run`
* workflow for GitHub actions creating releases for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Web (Wasm) ready for distribution
    * the same workflow creates development builds for the mobile platforms (two separate workflows can push to the stores after [some setup](#deploy-mobile-platforms))
    * push a tag in the form of `v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*` (e.g. `v1.1.42`) to trigger the flow
* CI workflow that checks your application on all native platforms on every push

WARNING: if you work in a private repository, please be aware that macOS and Windows runners cost more build minutes.
**For public repositories the workflow runners are free!**

# How to use this template?

 1. Click "Use this template" on the repository's page
 2. Look for `ToDo` to use your own game name everywhere
 3. [Update the icons as described below](#updating-the-icons)
 4. Start coding :tada:
    * Start the native app: `cargo run`
    * Start the web build: `trunk serve`
        * requires [trunk]: `cargo install --locked trunk`
        * requires `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`
        * this will serve your app on `8080` and automatically rebuild + reload it after code changes
    * Start the android app: `cargo apk run -p mobile`
        * requires following the instructions in the [bevy example readme for android setup][android-instructions]
    * Start the iOS app (see the [bevy example readme for ios setup instructions][ios-instructions])
        * Install Xcode through the app store
        * Launch Xcode and install the iOS simulator (check the box upon first start, or install it through `Preferences > Platforms` later)
        * Install the iOS and iOS simulator Rust targets with `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios x86_64-apple-ios aarch64-apple-ios-sim`
        * run `make run` inside the `/mobile` directory

You should keep the `credits` directory up to date. The release workflow automatically includes the directory in every build.

### Updating the icons
 1. Replace `build/macos/icon_1024x1024.png` with a `1024` times `1024` pixel png icon and run `create_icns.sh` or `create_icns_linux.sh` if you use linux (make sure to run the script inside the `build/macos` directory) - _Note: `create_icns.sh` requires a mac, and `create_icns_linux.sh` requires imagemagick and png2icns_
 2. Replace `build/windows/icon.ico` (used for windows executable and as favicon for the web-builds)
    * You can create an `.ico` file for windows by following these steps:
       1. Open `macos/AppIcon.iconset/icon_256x256.png` in [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/)
       2. Select the `File > Export As` menu item.
       3. Change the file extension to `.ico` (or click `Select File Type (By Extension)` and select `Microsoft Windows Icon`)
       4. Save as `build/windows/icon.ico`
 3. Replace `build/android/res/mipmap-mdpi/icon.png` with `macos/AppIcon.iconset/icon_256x256.png`, but rename it to `icon.png`

### Deploy web build to GitHub pages

 1. Trigger the `deploy-github-page` workflow
 2. Activate [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for your repository
     1. Source from the `gh-pages` branch (created by the just executed action)
 3. After a few minutes your game is live at `http://username.github.io/repository`

To deploy newer versions, just run the `deploy-github-page` workflow again.

# Deploy mobile platforms

For general info on mobile support, you can take a look at [one of my blog posts about mobile development with Bevy][mobile_dev_with_bevy_2] which is relevant to the current setup.

## Android

Currently, `cargo-apk` is used to run the development app. But APKs can no longer be published in the store and `cargo-apk` cannot produce the required AAB. This is why there is setup for two android related tools. In [`mobile/Cargo.toml`](./mobile/Cargo.toml), the `package.metadata.android` section configures `cargo-apk` while [`mobile/manifest.yaml`](./mobile/manifest.yaml) configures a custom fork of `xbuild` which is used in the `release-android-google-play` workflow to create an AAB.

There is a [post about how to set up the android release workflow][workflow_bevy_android] on my blog.

## iOS

The setup is pretty much what Bevy does for the mobile example.

There is a [post about how to set up the iOS release workflow][workflow_bevy_ios] on my blog.

# Removing mobile platforms

If you don't want to target Android or iOS, you can just delete the `/mobile`, `/build/android`, and `/build/ios` directories.
Then delete the `[workspace]` section from `Cargo.toml`.

# Getting started with Bevy

You should check out the Bevy website for [links to resources][bevy-learn] and the [Bevy Cheat Book] for a bunch of helpful documentation and examples. I can also recommend the [official Bevy Discord server][bevy-discord] for keeping up to date with the development and getting help from other Bevy users.

# Known issues

Audio in web-builds can have issues in some browsers. This seems to be a general performance issue and not due to the audio itself (see [bevy_kira_audio/#9][firefox-sound-issue]).
